# Lestrade TEI Tagger
Lestrade TEI Tagger takes plain text and turns it into a TEI-tagged document. It uses Mathematica/Wolfram
Language's text entity recognition system to detect entities to be tagged. The end goal is to use
Wolfram Language entity data to extract additional information about tagged entities.

Lestrade TEI Tagger is based off of Audrey Holmes' [Histrical Markup Tool](http://www.historical-markup.com),
which used Flair to detect entities.
